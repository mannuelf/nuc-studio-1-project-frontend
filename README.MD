## Built with

This project is built with node.js and ParcelJs, install both on your machine.

[https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/)

[https://parceljs.org/](https://parceljs.org/)

## To develop

Install the npm packages using the terminal. This will install ParcelJs a modern bundler. [https://parceljs.org/](https://parceljs.org/)

```bash
npm install
```

## Start the development server

```bash
npm run develop

Start coding and Navigate to [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234)

## But why?

We want to write with modern ES6 JavaScript with imports & exports + TypeScript. I have made the files TypeScript so that we can get better error linting.

Just write normal JavaScript in the TypeScript file, valid JavaScript is valid TypeScript.

Parcel will compile your the modern JS into ES5 for older browser support.
